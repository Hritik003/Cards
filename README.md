# Cards Project using GOlang

## Variable Declartions in Go?

`var card string = "Ace"`

- **var**: we are about to create a new variable
- **card**: The name of the variable 
- Only a `string ` will ever be assigned to this variable
- Assign the value "Ace" to this variable

## usage of For loop 

``` golang
for i, card := range cards {
		fmt.Println(i, card)
	}
```
